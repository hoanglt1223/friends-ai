Concept:
Gen Z often has a close circle of friends, cousins, or siblings with whom they share everything — this project recreates that circle digitally as a personalized AI board. Each member can be given a distinct personality, and the AI role-plays them consistently.

Interface:

Familiar chat-app style (similar to Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or WeChat).
Users can choose interface themes.
Conversations always start with the user sharing something.
AI members respond with advice, comfort, congratulations, or questions—according to their personalities.
If the user’s message is unclear, AI members should actively probe, ask follow-up questions, and push the conversation forward.
Admin Dashboard:

Manage AI personalities, prompts, feature options, and system parameters.
Purpose:
To give introverts or people with limited social circles a safe, supportive group that feels like close friends or family. The app offers daily psychological support and companionship, inspired by the dynamics found in school dramas or online romance stories.

Use Case Examples:

A user shares a personal struggle, joy, or sadness.
AI board members react in character, offering empathy, advice, or encouragement.
Over time, the board becomes an indispensable emotional support system for the user.
